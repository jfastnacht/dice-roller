# Dice-Roller

> A simple pen & paper dice roller written in PHP.

## Installation

Install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

`composer global install jfastnacht/dice-roller dev-develop`

## Usage

If you have set your PATH for Composer binaries use:

`dice-roller dice:roll 1d20+2`

to roll a d20 dice +2. If not use the absolute path instead.

## Contribution

Feel free to fork or use the parser code, it's probably not the best way to implement that anyways.
